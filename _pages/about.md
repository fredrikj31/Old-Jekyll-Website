Hello There :wave:

As said a couple of times on the home page, my name is Fredrik Johansen and I’m a junior developer. I’m currently studying programming and mathematics in a high school located in Copenhagen, Denmark. My passion and hopefully my near future livelihood is programming, and therefore have I been coding for about 7 years.

# Where It All Started
It all started when I fell over a plugin called [Skript](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/skript), thereafter I started making my custom script to a Minecraft server. That moment was the moment I realized the possibilities with programming. You could create anything you had in mind, with just a couple of lines of code.

After programming a bit of time in Minecraft, I tried to get started with web development, so I started like everyone else. [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html), [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css), and a bit of [Javascript](https://www.w3schools.com/js). Then one of my closest friends introduced me to one of his family members, who had a lot of experience in PHP at that point. On a vaccine to Tenerife, he gave me a crash course in [PHP](https://www.w3schools.com/php), and afterward, I fell in love with backend coding. I started creating some more complicated websites, that also included connections to different databases.

# Spare Time Other Than Coding
I have other hobbies then coding. My other passion is music, and it's also one of my getaway methods. I started DJ'ing back when I was around 11-12 years old, when I have watched Avicii's [levels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ovdm2yX4MA) on my parents computer. It was also there when I fell in love with electronic music.

My other thing I focus on is the gym. I like to workout because it's a good time to focus on other things then the things that's going on in the everyday life. It helps both with physical, mental and bug fixing :bug:
